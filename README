scratch

* my personal repo for code where I figure out basic things, test ideas and so on

* the repo might contain examples and copies of code from other places which may
  all have differing usage terms -- check for these terms before using anything!
 
* if no usage terms are mentioned, you may use the code here under

* please keep in mind everything here is just 'scratch' -- a mix of notes and
  half working code; it's probably a bad idea to directly use anything here
  in a real project!
